# Logistic Regression with Python

We will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a very famous data set and very often is a first step in machine learning! 

We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.

We'll use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this notebook.

You need 
titanic_test.csv
titanic_train.csv
